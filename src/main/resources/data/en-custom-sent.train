A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago, researchers reported.
This form of asbestos was particularly harmful to workers who handled it regularly.
The high number of deaths associated with this exposure has raised significant concerns within the scientific community.
However, efforts to regulate asbestos use have only been partially successful in reducing further incidents.
The new law passed in 2000 has created tighter regulations for companies using asbestos.
There are still challenges in enforcing these regulations effectively across industries.
Some countries have managed to ban asbestos entirely, while others continue to use it under certain conditions.
